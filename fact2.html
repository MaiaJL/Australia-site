                home to some of the most interesting animals. They are most known for Kangaroos <br> and Koalas. 
                Have you ever been driving down the road and seen a deer crossing sign? <br> Well, in australia they 
                have these for their Kangaroos. Kangaroos keep their young (also known as joeys) in a pouch 
                in their stomach until they are able to be out in the world.
